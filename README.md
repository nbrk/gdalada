# Low-level Ada bindings to GDAL

GDAL is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats that is released under 
an X/MIT style Open Source License by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation.

`Gdalada` is thin, auto-generated Ada bindings for the following subset of GDAL:
- cpl_*.h: **Common Portability Library C API**
- gdal.h: **Raster C API**
- ogr_core.h and ogr_api.h: **Vector C API**
- gdal_alg.h: **GDAL Algorithms C API**
- ogr_srs_api.h: **Spatial Reference System C API**
- gdal_utils.h: **GDAL Algorithms C API**

Ada specifications were generated by `gcc -fdump-ada-spec` from the C headers of GDAL version 3.3.2. 

The specification source code was amalgamated, slightly edited by hand and organized in the following Ada package hierarchy for convenience:
```
Gdalada
└───CPL
└───GDAL
└───GDAL_Alg
└───GDAL_Utils
└───OGR
└───OGR_SRS
└───Gdalwarper
```

You probably want to add something like that to your application's `.gpr` file to link with the system `gdal` library:

``` Ada
   package Linker is
      for Switches("Ada") use ("-lgdal");
   end Linker;
```

Highly untested, WIP.
